## Writing assignment 3

I have yet to have any of my work reviewed for publishing. However, I have gone through multiple rounds of editing on my manuscript from a diverse range of committee members and peers. The issue of conflicting edits or edits that are not helpful are very common and something I have struggled with in the past. I currently have the advantage of having a lead PI within the editing process. This allows everyone to be on the same page regarding which edits take first priority. This allows me to only accept edits that my PI would also approve. In the peer review process there is no hierarchy in reviewers which forces the author to take all opinions into account.

When dealing with conflicting reviewers I believe it is up to the author to make the best judgment on which edits to follow. The author will understand his/her project better than anyone else and the small details that it took to form the manuscript. With this added knowledge the author must take into account which edit aligns with their own project the most. If one reviewer is wanting a piece of writing to go in different direction than the project has a whole then I think it is reasonable to ignore this edit. It is also up to the author to defend and justify ignoring and accepting edits. I believe this process actually makes the manuscript better by improving your argument within the paper. If a single reviewer continues to have issues that do not match the other reviewer then I think it is the responsibility of the editor to change the reviewers.
