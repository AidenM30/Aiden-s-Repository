I have yet to have any of my work reviewed for publishing. However, I have gone through multiple rounds of editing on my manuscript from a diverse range of committee members and peers. The issue of conflicting edits or edits that are not helpful are very common and something I have struggled with in the past. I currently have the advantage of having a lead PI within the editing process. This allows everyone to be on the same page regarding which edits take first priority. This allows me to only accept edits that my PI would also approve. In the peer review process there is no hierarchy in reviewers which forces the author to take all opinions into account.

When dealing with conflicting reviewers I believe it is up to the author to make the best judgment on which edits to follow. The author will understand his/her project better than anyone else and the small details that it took to form the manuscript. With this added knowledge the author must take into account which edit aligns with their own project the most. If one reviewer is wanting a piece of writing to go in different direction than the project has a whole then I think it is reason

able to ignore this edit. It is also up to the author to defend and justify ignoring and accepting edits. I believe this process actually makes the manuscript better by improving your argument within the paper. If a single reviewer continues to have issues that do not match the other reviewer then I think it is the responsibility of the editor to change the reviewers.

Predatory journals play a massive role in the dissemination of false or misleading information. Because science and the peer review process has established research as a trustworthy source of information, predatory journals have been able to pass off low quality or false research as credible information by appearing to have the same rigorous peer review process as other journals. This low barrier to publish allows the scientific literature to be flooded with poor or false papers. These papers can have important consequences on public opinion and even policy. On one end of the spectrum are authors who have made mistakes in their research and publish papers in predatory journals out of ignorance. These papers are then read by other and increase the confusion around a topic. This hinders scientific progress and leads to false conclusions. On the other end of the spectrum are authors with malcontent who knowingly create false research or results in order to better their own interests. This creates major division in the public perception of science quality and honesty. Those with aligning beliefs are lead to believe that because a paper was published it must be true. This creates issues in the most back discussions on what is fact or not.

In the fisheries research field I believe predatory journals prey more on authors with sub par research that may have mistakes within them. These paper generally are not meant to make any major claims that would have overreaching impacts on society as a whole. However predatory journals within fisheries do slow down progress by flooding the literature with poor science. These paper are difficult to sift through and require attention to detail when citing papers from different journals.
